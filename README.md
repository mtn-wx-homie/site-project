Eventually this will form the basis for a website where I plan to host a bunch of weather forecasting tools. 

So far I have a few tools that take in .grib files from the HRRR over AWS and plot the data in some interesting ways. I'm still tooling around with ideas, but the eventual final product will have all of the usual forecasting accoutrements
& a few extras: 
-700mb temp & inst. precip rate overlaid clearly over UDOT road network (helps for road wx forecasting, snow level forecasting at a glance, great for when I'm giving briefings at work
-really nice 4 panel plots of the great basin area & UDOT level zooms
-some downscaled snow forecast products, ideally taking an ensemble based approach. Will project these results over UDOT region maps, excited to play with this idea
